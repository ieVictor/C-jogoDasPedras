 ## Movements
The first two inputs (x, y) must correspond to a stone on the board that will be moved to the second set of coordinates (x, y), which must be a valid move to an empty space.

When a move is made, the user is shown the details of the move executed, the number of stones removed, and the number of stones remaining on the board.
